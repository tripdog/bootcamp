# Flavio Copes' Full Stack JavaScript Bootcamp notes

I was using Brainscape to record my notes and go back an quiz myself. This was great
when we were studying a lot of theory. But now, the lessons are much more code heavy
and Brainscape doesn't support markdown or code formatting. So I found a new tool
called https://hackmd.io . It's wonderful because now it syncs with my GitHub account
and it uses markdown just like GH does too.
